										We are thrilled to force you all to come visit us!  Read on for details of the hotel block associated with the wedding, ways to get into the city from different airports, information about using the MTA, and getting to Brooklyn Grange @ Sunset Park.  Temperatures will likely be 70-80&#176;F (21-26.5&#176;C).

											<h3>Hotel Block</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											We have arranged a room block at <a href="">Hotel Name</a> with rooms priced at $$/night for Thursday through Saturday nights (i.e., Check-in August 17, check-out August 20).  To reserve a room, please ...

											<h3>Airports</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											There are three airports serving the New York area--LaGuardia, JFK, and Newark.  A taxi ride into the city is cheapest from LaGuardia.  Getting into the city by public transit is easiest from JFK.  See the <a href="#subway">"Getting Around the City"</a> section for more MTA information.
										</p>
										<h4>LaGuardia Airport</h4>
										<p>
											We recommend taking a taxi (~$35) or Uber (~$55).
										</p>
										<p>
											You can also take the free Q70-SBS (Special Bus Service) to the Jackson Heights-Roosevelt Ave subway station.  From there, climb many stars to transfer to the E (blue), F/M (orange), or R (yellow) subway to get into Manhattan.
										</p>
										<h4>JFK Airport</h4>
										<p>
											We recommend taking the Jamaica AirTrain (red) from your terminal to the Jamaica subway station.  To exit the station, you must pay $8 using a MetroCard.  Right before the exit turnstiles, there is a line of MetroCard machines.  From Jamaica station, take the E (blue, $2.75 fare) to midtown Manhattan.  Getting to the E will be a long enough walk that you will start to get worried, but it is a well labeled walk, and you will be fine.
										</p>
										<p>
											A taxi/Uber from JFK Airport to Manhattan costs on average ~$60-75.
										</p>
										<h4>Newark Airport</h4>
										<p>
											We recommend taking the AirTrain from your terminal to the RailLink station.  At the RailLink station, board any <a href="https://www.njtransit.com/airport">NJ Transit train</a> heading to New York to arrive at New York Penn Station.  Tickets can be bought at the RailLink station ($15.50 for one way adult).  Trains arrive every 15-20 minutes.
										</p>
										<p>
											A taxi/Uber from Newark Airport to Manhattan costs on average ~$55-60.
										</p>
										<p>
											For our friends to the North (<span class="icon brands fa-canadian-maple-leaf"></span>), we have had good success using <a href="https://www.flyporter.com/en-ca/">Porter Airlines</a>, a budget airline that flies from much of Eastern Canada to Newark Airport.

											<h3>Getting Around the City</h3>
										</header>
										<h4><span class="icon solid fa-walking"></span> Walking</h4>
										<p>
											Manhattan is extremely walkable and safe.  Walking 10 streets (which run north/south) is about half a mile (0.8 km); avenues (which run east/west) are separated by approximatley 1/7 a mile (0.2 km).
										</p>

										<h4><span class="icon solid fa-subway"></span> MTA</h4>
										<p>
											The fare for subways and buses is typically $2.75, which can be paid with any payment method that has tap functionality or with a MetroCard.  MetroCards can be purchased at most subway stops.  All new MetroCards come with a $1 fee.  Google Maps is shockingly abreast of subway delays.  Trust Google Maps.  We have dobuted Google Maps before to our own detriment.
											</p><p>
											<b>Pro tip</b>: some subway entrances only allow access to subways going in one direction.  Make sure to read the subway sign before dashing down/up any stairs.
										</p>

										<h4><span class="icon solid fa-car-side"></span> Driving</h4>
										<p>
											Driving will probably be a mistake.  It is sometimes scary, always annoying, and nearly never necessary.  Street parking is available for the patient and the skilled, though for longer stays we recommend finding a parking garage.  Do not be fooled by fire hydrants (you must park 15 feet away).  Do not turn right on red.
											</p><p>
											For rideshare apps, Uber is somehow always cheaper than Lyft.

											<h3>Parking at the Venue</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Parking at the venue will be street parking only.  There usually is street parking in the area with metered parking available under the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (i.e., the Gowanus Expressway).  Meters expire at 7 PM after which parking is free.  While the venue has a parking lot in front of it, this lot closes on Fridays at 8 PM at which point any vehicles remaining in the lot will be locked in.
