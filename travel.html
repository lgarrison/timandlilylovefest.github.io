											<h3>Airports</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											There are three airports serving the New York area--LaGuardia, JFK, and Newark.  Newark tends to have the most afordable flights and is a NJ Transit train-ride away from Manhattan.  LaGuardia really is better than it once was.  JFK is two MTA-run trains from Manhattan.  See the <a href="#subway">"Getting Around the City"</a> section for more MTA information.
										</p>
										<h4>LaGuardia Airport</h4>
										<p>
											<span class="icon solid fa-subway"> The free Q70-SBS (Special Bus Service) leaves from all LaGuardia terminals (follow signs for "Buses/Shuttles".  Take the Q70 to Roosevelt Ave/74th street, the first stop.  Transfers are then available to the E (blue), F/M (orange), or R (yellow) subway to get into Manhattan.
										</p>
										<p>
											<span class="icon solid fa-car-side"></span> From LaGuardia Airport to Manhattan, a taxi runs about ~$35 while an Uber is ~$55.
										</p>
										<p>
											<b>Pro tip</b>: Do not sleep on the 25-foot aquagraphic curtain in Terminal B.  Every 15 minutes it does a cute little water, light, and audio show.  Step aside, Bellagio!
										</p>
										<h4>JFK Airport</h4>
										<p>
											<span class="icon solid fa-subway"> The Jamaica AirTrain (red) leaves from all terminals to the Jamaica subway station.  No payment is required to board, but there is an $8 exit fee at Jamaica station you must pay using a MetroCard.  Right before the exit turnstiles, there is a line of MetroCard machines for purchasing new cards or reloading a card.  We suggest getting a card with at least $10.75 on it.  From Jamaica station, take the E (blue, $2.75 fare) to midtown Manhattan.  Getting to the E from the AirTrain exit will be a long enough walk that you will start to get worried, but it is a well labeled walk and you will be fine.
										</p>
										<p>
											<span class="icon solid fa-car-side"></span> A taxi/Uber from JFK Airport to Manhattan costs on average ~$60-75.
										</p>
										<h4>Newark Airport</h4>
										<p>
											<span class="icon solid fa-subway"> We recommend taking the AirTrain from your terminal to the RailLink station.  At the RailLink station, board any <a href="https://www.njtransit.com/airport"target="_blank">NJ Transit train</a> heading to New York to arrive at New York Penn Station.  Tickets can be bought at the RailLink station ($15.50 for one way adult).  Trains arrive every 15-20 minutes.
										</p>
										<p>
											<span class="icon solid fa-car-side"></span> A taxi/Uber from Newark Airport to Manhattan costs on average ~$55-60.
										</p>
										<p>
											<span class="icon brands fa-canadian-maple-leaf"></span> For our friends to the North, we have had good success using <a href="https://www.flyporter.com/en-ca/" target="_blank">Porter Airlines</a>, a budget airline that flies from much of Eastern Canada to Newark Airport.

											<h3>Getting Around the City</h3>
										</header>
										<h4><span class="icon solid fa-walking"></span> Walking</h4>
										<p>
											Manhattan is extremely walkable and safe.  Walking 10 streets (i.e., walking north/south) is about half a mile (0.8 km); walking between avenues (i.e., walking east/west) is equivalent to approximately 1/7 a mile (0.2 km).
										</p>

										<h4><span class="icon solid fa-subway"></span> MTA</h4>
										<p>
											The fare for subways and buses is typically $2.75, which can be paid with any payment method that has tap functionality (i.e., a credit card or a fancy phone) or with a MetroCard.  MetroCards can be purchased at most subway stops.  All new MetroCards come with a $1 fee.
										</p>
										<p>
											<b>Pro tip</b>: some subway entrances only allow access to subways going in one direction.  Make sure to read the subway station sign before dashing down/up any stairs.
										</p>

										<h4><span class="icon solid fa-car-side"></span> Driving</h4>
										<p>
											We do not reccomend driving in the city.  It is sometimes scary, always annoying, and nearly never necessary.  Street parking is available for the patient and the skilled, though for longer stays we recommend finding a parking garage.  Do not park within 15 feet of a fire hydrant.  Do not turn right on red.
										</p>
										<!--<p>
											For rideshare apps, Uber is somehow always cheaper than Lyft.

											<h3>Weather</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											New York in late August tends to have lows around 70&#176;F (21&#176;C) and highs around 80&#176;F (26.7&#176;C).  During the wedding, temperatures are likely to start at around 80&#176;F (26.7&#176;C) and drop to around 73&#176;F (22.7&#176;C) by the end of the event.  It can get humid in August, but will only rain on 9-13 days throughout the month.

											<h3>Things To Do</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											New York City definitely has things to do.  We have a few initial suggestions here and intend to keep adding suggestions as we continue to do things!
										</p>
										<p>
											<span class="icon solid fa-utensils"></span> What you absolute have to do is go to any <a href="https://www.xianfoods.com/" target="_blank">XiAn Famous Foods</a> location.  Order the Liang Pi (A1) and a Lamb Burger (B2).  You can adjust the spicy level for the noodles, but if any fire needs quenching we recommend the jasmine tea (unsweetened) or the chrysanthemum tea (delightfully sweetend).
										</p>
										<p>
											<span class="icon solid fa-dog"></span> Madison Square Park has a new dog park on itss west side that is both more spacious and has more ammenities than most New York apartments.
										</p>
										<p>
											<span class="icon solid fa-coffee"></span> <a href="https://www.devocion.com/pages/cafes" target="_blank">Devocion Coffee</a> has a cappuccino that will ruin all other cappuccinos for you.
										</p>
										<p>
											<span class="icon solid fa-camera-retro"></span> Our (Tim's) favorite art museum is the <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/" target="_blank">Guggenheim</a>.  It is modern art, consider yourself warned, and is in a striking building worth a visit for the architecture alone.  Those who experience vertigo, beware.  To make a day of it, we recommend brunching at <span class="icon solid fa-utensils"></span>  <a href="https://www.barkingdognyc.com/east-94th-st-menu/" target="_blank">The Barking Dog</a> on 3rd and 94th before heading to the museum and taking a stroll through <span class="icon solid fa-leaf"></span> Central Park after.
